# Mégra

Mégra is a mini-language to make music with variable-order markov chains
and some other stochastic shenanigans.

**This is Mégra 1.x ! Mégra 2.x is in the making and will bring some breaking changes, so stay tuned !**

## Installation
There are currently two ways to install. One uses **Portacle** as the underlying editor 
and is comparatively easy. You can find the instructions here:

https://github.com/the-drunk-coder/megra/blob/master/Tutorial/00_Installation.md

If you're familar with Common Lisp and Emacs, and want to integrate Mégra into your current
Emacs installation, please find some hints here:

## Learning

Currently, there are two Tutorials. 

The *new*, main tutorial is in the making. It provides more in-depth explanations
about the inner workings of Mégra. Please find it in:

https://github.com/the-drunk-coder/megra/blob/master/Tutorial/

The historical, *old* tutorial was written as the language
evolved. It covers a good lot of the language, but the order in which things are explained might not be 
all that reasonable. You can find it in:

## Technicalities

Mégra is an embedded domain-specific language based on **Common Lisp**,
Tito Latini's amazing **Incudine** library and **Common Music 2.x**, which
is old but working, and currently (inofficially and as needed) maintained
by Orm Finnendahl.
